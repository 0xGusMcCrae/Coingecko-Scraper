A coingecko webscraper

I currently have it set to find all coins with marketcaps between 250 thousand and 5 million

I plan on adding functionality to check for coin launch date to screen for recent launches, and I'd also like
to try to get it to automatically check for social media metrics like twitter follows, discord membership, etc

The goal is to find some low cap gems for the next cycle!

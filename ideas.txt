    might want to make a function that takes the url as an input and then does the basic scraping process (once I figure out what that is) 
and then I can loop through the pages on coingecko (perhaps by incrementing the page # within the url string) to search for coins meeting
certain criteria i.e. under a certain marketcap. And eventually even have it do stuff like look at social media presence, etc. But start
with the basics lls. And maybe have it print to a file the coins that are worth further investigation.

    also could have it navigate webpages by finding the name of the coin within the html and then going to the url - like it could find the 
name and then request.get from 'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/<coin name>'

    and the page incrementation could be done => the format is 'https://www.coingecko.com/?page=<page number>' and I could just do a loop that
increments the page number.

    for criteria, I probably want like sub 5 or 10m marketcap and created recently - need to figure out how recently I want, though.

    I can have it automatically go to the coin's page by parsing out the coin name (not ticker) and adding that to the url as seen above
and to be honest I might want to just change the code to get it to print the name instead of (or in addition to) the ticker

    Or I can copy the url snippet directly from the tag - it's like in the one below:
        <a class="tw-flex tw-items-start md:tw-flex-row tw-flex-col" href="/en/coins/tera">
    and then just append that on to the https://www.coingecko.com/

    but if I do want to do the name (possibly easier), the element is this:
    <span class="lg:tw-flex font-bold tw-items-center tw-justify-between">TERA</span>


    coingecko does have follower metrics
    add #socials to the end of the coin url
    and the div for twitter followers is this:
    <div class="mt-4 mb-2 text-2xl">21,215</div>
    which is a child of this guy:
    <div class="social-circle tw-flex flex-column tw-justify-start tw-items-center">
    <div class="mt-5"><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" class="text-3xl" href="https://twitter.com/mtpelerin"><i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i></a></div>
    <div class="mt-4 mb-2 text-2xl">16,358</div>
    <div class="uppercase text-2xs"><span class="translation_missing" title="translation missing: en.coins.socials.social.twitter_followers">Twitter Followers</span></div>
    </div>
    I might be able to search by the twitter link or the "twitter followers" text within the span

    and date added to coingecko can be found in this div on the coin page:
    <text x="2" data-z-index="1" y="15.5">Apr 21, 2021</text>
    which is a child of this element:
    <g class="highcharts-label highcharts-range-input" transform="translate(0,0)"><rect class="highcharts-label-box" x="0.5" y="0.5" width="78" height="21"></rect><text x="2" data-z-index="1" y="15.5">Apr 21, 2021</text></g>

    just try and find good person coin to start and then go from there

    getting a bunch of the page you're looking for could not be found errors

    I think I might be better off going to their twitter to find followers
    and maybe just get the twitter join date from there

    twitter followers div:
    <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">113.4K</span>

    Twitter joined date div:
    <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Joined April 2020</span>

    apparently beautifulsoup can't load dynamic pages, and since the elements I want are being created
    by javascript after the initial load, I need to find a workaround

    even with the html.render thing it's still not loading what I want it to load, I might just
    have to go to the twitter page for this stuff

     sesh = HTMLSession()
    response = sesh.get(tokenUrl)
    response.html.render()
    
    tokenSoup = BeautifulSoup(response.html.raw_html,'html.parser')
    tried this, didnt work

    gonna try to grab the href out of the parent of this div:
    <i class="fab mr-1 fa-twitter"></i>

    can grab twitter join date from this div:
    <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Joined November 2017</span>

    I still want to parse the join date to a date format so I can filter for 
    join dates within the past like 6 months or so.

    followers from this div:
    <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">113.5K</span>

    but apperently twitter might not work with requests.get anymore

    somehow the follower and join date classes are the same? seems weird since they're clearly different css properties
    and requests only finds one item with that class in the page - twitter is clearly up to shenanigans

    maybe I'm just gonna have to to use the stupid twitter api
